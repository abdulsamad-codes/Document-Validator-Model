Pure, side-effect free functions that measure document quality: sharpness
(Variance of Laplacian), rotation (Hough line estimation) and PDF page
rendering. They never raise the module's domain exceptions -- exception-raising
checks live in :mod:`app.technical_validation.validators` -- so the service can
treat a ``None`` return as "could not analyse" without coupling to error types.

    ensures that a sparse page with sharp text correctly scores high, while
    preventing localized noise (like a single sharp staple mark) from causing
    a completely blurry page to falsely pass. The result is compared against
