"""Runs the post-OCR verification pipeline for one application.

Chains the four stages that were previously only reachable by calling their
own HTTP endpoints directly -- something nothing in this codebase actually
did (confirmed by reading every service and grepping the frontend): document
analysis, confidence evaluation, normalization and business-rule validation.
The required order is not the one implied by the README's pipeline diagram;
it's fixed by a real data dependency confirmed by reading each service:
confidence is the *only* writer of ``extracted_fields`` rows, and
normalization requires that table to be non-empty. So analysis must run
before confidence, and confidence before normalization, or normalization
raises ``NoExtractedFields`` immediately.

Invoked by :class:`app.bulk_queue.workers.BulkQueueWorker` for
``APPLICATION_PIPELINE`` jobs, once every ``DOCUMENT_OCR`` job of an
application has reached a terminal state. Each stage already tolerates
missing/partial per-document or per-field data on its own (see their
docstrings -- "the run always completes"); the only failures this can
realistically raise are genuine bugs or database errors, which propagate to
the caller and are retried by the same queue machinery already proven for
OCR jobs.
