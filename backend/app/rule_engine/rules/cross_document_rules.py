"""Cross-document consistency rules.

Each rule compares the normalized value of one field across a set of documents
that must agree. A participant that is entirely missing fails the rule (the
comparison cannot be made and the document set is already incomplete), as does
a participant that lacks the field, and any disagreement between the values
fails the rule outright.

    ever has a Bank Name + Account No column, never an Account Title/Holder

    permanently unpassable for every real application. AMC and Tripartite
