"""API package.

Aggregates every versioned router into a single ``api_router`` that the FastAPI
application mounts under the configured API prefix. Future feature routers
(upload, validation, etc.) are registered on ``protected_router`` below so the
application factory does not need to change when new endpoints are added, and
so a new router is authenticated by default.

Every route requires a valid session (``Depends(get_current_user)``, applied
once here rather than per-router) except ``health`` and the ``auth`` module
itself. Applying this per-router individually is what shipped 13 of 14 modules
with no auth enforcement at all in the first place -- see CONTEXT.md's
2026-08-14 entries -- so it is applied globally, with an explicit allowlist
for the two routers that must stay reachable pre-session, rather than opt-in
per module.
