"""Configuration for the document processing module.

Centralizes the document source classification, the processing methods and OCR
engine identifiers, and the thresholds that drive routing and timeout behaviour.
The service and processor code consume these constants, so tuning a threshold or
adding a processing method never requires touching the route or schema layers.
