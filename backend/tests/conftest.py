"""Shared fixtures for the upload test suite.

Uploads are exercised through the real FastAPI application. The database is a
**dedicated test database** (``TEST_DATABASE_URL``, or the development database
name suffixed ``_test``): the ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable is pointed
at it *before any application module is imported*, so the SQLAlchemy engine and
session factory built at import time bind to the test database -- never the
live development database that the running backend and queue worker use. A
session-scoped autouse fixture recreates the test database schema from scratch
(``alembic upgrade head``) once per run.

The storage backend is redirected to a per-test temporary directory so the
repository's ``storage/`` tree is never touched. The database is wiped before
and after every test via the cascade on ``applications`` (which removes
documents, OCR data, validations and reviews); ``_wipe_database`` additionally
refuses to run at all against a database whose name doesn't contain "test", as
a second, independent guard against ever wiping the real development database.

# Point the application engine at a dedicated test database BEFORE any app
# module is imported. ``app.database.connection`` builds its engine and session
# factory at import time from ``DATABASE_URL``, so this must run before the
# ``from app...`` imports below.
#
# The development URL is read from the same ``.env`` file the application uses
# (``os.environ`` does not contain it unless it was exported), and the test URL
# is derived by appending ``_test`` to the database name. A caller can override
# either side explicitly via ``TEST_DATABASE_URL``.
