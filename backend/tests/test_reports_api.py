    # PDF-probed text, 0 missing) -- the fleet-wide mean shifted because the
    # field-count composition of the fleet changed, not because of a new gap.
    # Recalibrated again 2026-08-17: ONE_LINK_LETTER now has its own real
    # extractor too (see ONE_LINK_LETTER_TEXT above) instead of falling
    # through to BANK_STATEMENT_TEXT -- fully covered on its own 2-field

    # template is now organization_name alone (still 0 missing, still fully
    # covered) -- verified via the actual test run, not derived by hand.

    # real-shaped text (SYNTHETIC_FORMAL_REQUEST_LETTER) instead of falling
    # through to BANK_STATEMENT_TEXT, so it now contributes its own real
    # extracted-field confidence scores to the fleet-wide mean instead of a
    # fully-covered 9-field bank statement's -- same shift pattern as the
    # entries above, verified via the actual test run.
    # Recalibrated again 2026-08-22: BILATERAL_STATEMENT_TEXT (test_rule_engine_api.py)

    # has one, so its own template coverage is honestly lower than the old
    # synthetic fixture's -- same shift pattern as the entries above, verified
    # via the actual test run.
    # Recalibrated again 2026-08-22 (second time same day): SCHEDULE_OF_CHARGES
    # removed from REQUIRED_DOCUMENT_TYPES (see CONTEXT.md) -- build_full_application
    # now builds seven documents instead of eight, dropping the fully-covered
