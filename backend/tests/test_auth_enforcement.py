"""Regression coverage for the global auth dependency.

Until 2026-08-14, `get_current_user` was wired into exactly one router
(`bulk_queue`, covered by `test_bulk_queue.py::test_unauthenticated_requests_
rejected`) -- the other 13 route modules had no auth enforcement at all,
despite handling real application data (documents, extracted fields, human
review decisions). See `app/api/__init__.py` for the fix: a single
`dependencies=[Depends(get_current_user)]` applied to a `protected_router`
that wraps every module except `health` and `auth` itself.

This file is the regression test for that gap: every endpoint outside those
two modules must reject an unauthenticated request with 401. It intentionally
does not re-list the 7 `bulk_queue` endpoints already covered by
`test_bulk_queue.py`.
